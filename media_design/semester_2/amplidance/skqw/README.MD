# SKQW - A cross-platform audio visualizer built on Electron
Because we wanted to visualize our sound waves, I went online to look for a solution or an environment where this could easily be done. Then I discovered SKQW which was developed by Michael Bromley inspired by WinAmp.

Electron load your javascript file and show it in the app.


## How to use
First download the software from [https://github.com/michaelbromley/skqw/releases](https://github.com/michaelbromley/skqw/releases) 
Then you unpack it ...

I put my designs inside the folder -> \SKQW\app-1.0.0-beta2\resources\app\library
If everything works properly then you can place my .js files in an folder inside the library directory.
